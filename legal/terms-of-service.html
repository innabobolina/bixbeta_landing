        <p>This section on Arbitration is important, so please read it carefully as it affects your rights and the resolution of any complaints or disputes that may arise between you and BixBeta. You and BixBeta agree that this section meets the requirement for writing under the Federal Arbitration Act, and can only be amended by mutual agreement.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements you may have with us informally. However, by using the Site, you agree that any such complaints, disputes, or disagreements, as well as any claims BixBeta may have against you, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS or its successor and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the arbitration begins. These procedures will not conflict with subpart (e) below. This section does not prevent either party from seeking provisional remedies from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>a) The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator selected according to the rules of JAMS or by mutual agreement between you and BixBeta. </p>
        <p>b) The arbitrator, not any court or agency, will have the exclusive authority to resolve any disputes related to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and the arbitration provisions.</p>
        <p>c) The arbitration may take place at a location determined by JAMS, as long as it is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel more than 100 miles from your home or place of business, or at a location mutually agreed upon by you and BixBeta.</p>
        <p>d) The arbitrator will apply the internal laws of the State of New York, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations. If federal law prevails, the law of the U.S. will be applied, regardless of any conflict of law principles. The arbitrator may consider motions to dismiss, strike, or for any other type of legal or equitable relief and will have the authority to award such relief.</p>
        <p>e) If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or in conflict with the applicable rules, the rest of the provision will remain in effect and will be interpreted in accordance with its terms. BixBeta may modify these arbitration provisions, but any such modifications will only become effective 30 days after BixBeta has given notice and will only apply prospectively.</p>
        <p>(f) Modification of Arbitration Clause with Notice. BixBeta may modify these arbitration provisions, but any modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after BixBeta has given notice of the modifications and only on a prospective basis.</p>
